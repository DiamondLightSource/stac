XO: Crystal Orientation tools
Copyright (C) 2005, Pierre Legrand (see LICENSE)
######################################################################

This is the first (alpha) release (0.2.99) of XO, a set of tools
to handle Crystal Orientations.

Please remember that XO, like Python, comes with neither a price tag
nor any warranty (see the file LICENSE for details). I use it for my
own work, and I consider it reasonably stable, but your mileage may
vary.

If you find bugs with XO, please tell me! And, if you improve something,
please send me the modified version. I cannot promise extensive support
(I am a scientist, not a programmer, and much less a software distributor!),
but I'll do my best.


Installation
============

Prerequisites: Python 2.1 or higher. Also work with jython 2.1 or higher.
Just add the XO-0.2.99/bin path to work PATH variable.
This new version of XO uses the pycgtypes mat3 and vec3 (part of the cgkit:
see cgkit.sf.net for more details). It does not depend any more on Numeric
Python.


Web site
========

The XO home page can be found at (to be updated):
http://www.synchotron-soleil.fr/bioxtal/kappa


Documentation
=============

A brief XO documentation is included in the "doc" directory.
All XO programs have an help (-h or --help) option that describes usage
and options.

Third party software used
=========================

The mat3 and vec3 classes are coming from the Python Computer Graphics
Kit v1.2.0 by Matthias Baas (see http://cgkit.sourceforge.net).
