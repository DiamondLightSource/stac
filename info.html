<h1>STAC overview</h1>



  
  
<h2>Reorientation and Strategy Features</h2>



  
<p>STAC is a powerful software framework for computer aided
reorientations of macromolecular crystalline samples. Based on the
characterization of a single crystal sample, STAC computes robotic
movements for reaching arbitrary crystal reorientations. Additionally,
it detrmines strategies for multiple wedge data collections about
different crystal axes. Integrating with data collection program suits,
like automateD CollectioN of datA (DNA), multiple crystals can be
screened about the same crystal axis for better smaple ranking, and also possible to easily collect data from automaticly
reoriented samples.</p>


<h2>Data Format Conversion</h2>



  
<p>STAC framework supports crystal characterization inputs from
various&nbsp;packages (eg: xds, denzo, mosflm, DNA).
&nbsp;Independently on the
original input, the crystal characteristics are converted into an
internal data model which supports all later computations.</p>


<h2>Develop the&nbsp;application once, install it on any multi-axis goniometer</h2>



  
<p>STAC handles any multi-axis goniometer as of an implementation of
Abstract Kappa System (AKS), one of the major design adavanteges of
the EMBL/ESRF MiniKappa. AKS assumes that the rotation devices are
supported by a 3D pure translation stage. This inverse system introduces flexibility
in placing the rotation axes in space. Using the easy procedure of
Translation and Rotation Calibrations, STAC automatically captures
the&nbsp;differences between the various multi-axis goniometer
implementations, and allows precise reorientation computations where
the accuracy is only limited by the operation of the hardware.</p>

<h2>Extendable design</h2>



  
<p>STAC is built up of Modules with supporting easy enhancement,
replacement, and/or extension of the implementations via its
Plugin-Slot architecture. The currently available Modules cover:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>

  <li>Xtal Reorientation Computation Module</li>

  <li>Data Collection Strategy Computation Module</li>

  <li>Beamline Configuration and Control Module</li>

</ul>
